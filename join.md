i made this ring mostly for my friends but if you are also a cool bird person you can join :)

to join the webring, please <a class="button" href="https://github.com/{{ site.repository }}/issues/new/choose">open a request</a> to add a new site through GitHub issues.

after you’re approved, you’ll need to add the webring code to your website:

{% include join-script.html %}
